I do not give up easily, and work to solve difficult problems with a dogged determination. I am self-reliant, able to work independently to quickly absorb new concepts to solve those difficult problems, but at the same time, work well with a team due to my military experience. These are the traits that I bring to a programming environment as a web developer.”</p>
